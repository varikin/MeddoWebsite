            A menu bar app for Mac that lists entries in the /etc/hosts file

          <p class="content">
            I have several entries for different staging servers that I need to frequently enable and disable. I wanted this easier.

            <h3>Reading /etc/hosts</h3>
            <p>
              The first part of the app is parsing /etc/hosts.
              The general idea is to look at a line and determine if it is a
              comment, host entry, commented out host entry, or blank line.
              Host entries are grouped into one item by the idea of
              zero or more comments followed by one or more host entries.
              Host groups are separated by comments 
              (not commented out host entries) and blank lines.
              A name for the group is determined by either 
              the first non blank comment (octothropes are ignored) or
              the first host name.
            </p><p>
              This works will for my setup, but I am open to enhancements based
              on anyone elses setup. 
              Send me a hosts file that is problematic and I will work on it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Currently, Meddo does not watch for changes to /etc/hosts.
              It reads the file on start.
              I am working on watching for filesystem changes, but it isn't working yet.
            <h3>Writing /etc/hosts</h3>
            <p>
              /etc/hosts is owned by root. Meddo runs as the user.
              To handle this issue, Apple provides a way to install helper tools
              that run as root.
              Meddo includes a helper tool:
            </p>
            <pre>
  /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools/com.fictitiousnonsense.MeddoHelper
  /Library/LaunchDaemons/com.fictitiousnonsense.MeddoHelper.plist</pre>
            <p>  
              When writing to /etc/hosts, Meddo check the version of the helper
              and installed a newer version if needed.
              It does prompt for the user's password at this time.
              All the helper does is write the file and send/recieve messages
              about writing the file.
              Everything else is done executed as the user.
